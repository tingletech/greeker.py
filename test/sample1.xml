<foo batz="potentially catastrophic flaw">

The NASA Space <bar>Shuttle Challenger disaster</bar> occurred on January
28, 1986 when Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into
its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members.
Disintegration of the entire vehicle began after an O-ring seal in
its right solid rocket booster failed at liftoff. The disaster
resulted in the formation of the Rogers Commission, a special
commission appointed by United States President Ronald Reagan to
investigate the accident. The Presidential Commission found that
NASA's organizational culture and decision-making processes had
been a key contributing factor to the accident. NASA managers had
known that contractor Morton Thiokol's design of the solid rocket
boosters contained a potentially catastrophic flaw in the O-rings,
but they failed to address it properly. They also disregarded
warnings from engineers about the dangers of launching posed by the
low temperatures of that morning.
