<p>As in typography, greeking involves inserting nonsense text or,
commonly, Greek or Latin text in prototypes of visual media projects
(such as in graphic and web design) to check the layout of the final
version before the actual text is available, or to enhance layout
assessment by eliminating the distraction of readable text.  Text
of this sort is known as "greeked text", "dummy text", or "jabberwocky
text".  Lorem ipsum is a commonly used example, though this is
derived from Latin, not Greek.</p><!-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeking -->
