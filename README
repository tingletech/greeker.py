EXAMPLE
-------

test/sample3.xml

<p>As in typography, greeking involves inserting nonsense text or,
commonly, Greek or Latin text in prototypes of visual media projects
(such as in graphic and web design) to check the layout of the final
version before the actual text is available, or to enhance layout
assessment by eliminating the distraction of readable text.  Text
of this sort is known as "greeked text", "dummy text", or "jabberwocky
text".  Lorem ipsum is a commonly used example, though this is
derived from Latin, not Greek.</p><!-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeking -->

test/3klein.xml

<p>As in wipafropki, greeking uxzints inserting kykdokdo vawv or,
commonly, Jbuuq or Tadog vawv in ndararonis of visual mohia fgupects
(such as in graphic and lim rojugs) to check the xioyul of the final
cifnyuh before the actual vawv is available, or to arserwa xioyul
ihhyhhjyct by ykutuzoquzw the wozmjaqmoyn of readable vawv.  Rylr
of this meks is known as "greeked vawv", "pyllu vawv", or "jabberwocky
vawv".  Cajum uflin is a commonly used uxavqmu, though this is
derived from Tadog, not Jbuuq.</p>

[I guess this is more like 1/2 greeking, since it is only the nouns]

-------
INSTALL
-------

This command should install greeker.py and its dependencies

  pip install https://github.com/tingletech/greeker.py/tarball/master

or if you haved checked out/downloaded this code, then you could go

  pip install .

Your will also need some data for the natural language toolkit to
function.  This command will grab the data for you.

  python -m nltk.downloader punkt maxent_treebank_pos_tagger

or just install the nltk data

  python -m nltk.downloader all

TODO
----

test/sample2.xml runs out of words where elements/text() are like this
  some text<tag>[<tag/>]</tag>some text

set up unit tests

think about attributes...for EAD, probably want to leave most if not all alone
